# Gamebox

The Gamebox is a simple app that contains two little games, and allow the player to play those games, and store their score online.
The main screen contains the list of different games with a name and a picture. If we can play to the game, a little icon is present. You can click on the game to see its details. 

For the playable games, you need to enter a player name and click on the "run" button. Two games are playable:
  - Hangman: you need to find the 8 characters' word, you have 11 lives. Just put your character in the field and find the word!
  - Sliding puzzle: you need to re create the original picture, by sliding the pieces. To move a piece you just need to click on it, be careful only the pieces next to the black piece can move. You only have 60 seconds to achieve it.
  

At the end of the games, you have access to the score list for the played game. Each score is presented with the date (date and hour), the player name, the game's name and the result. On this page you can go back to the main page with the button "back to the menu"

ENJOY
